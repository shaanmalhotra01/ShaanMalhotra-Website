        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Shaan Malhotra and I am a third-year undergraduate biology major at the University of California, Riverside who is passionate about community service and outreach in the greater Riverside area. Despite spending one of my three years totally remote, I have come to call Riverside home and I want to do everything in my power to make my community a better place while simultaneously earning my degree. My personal goal is to leave a lasting positive effect in the community that extends long past my 4 years at UCR. After earning my degree I hope to pursue medicine by attending medical school, but I believe in keeping my options open so I have not ruled out any alternate career paths. In order to best go about achieving the goal I outlined, l have become active in various volunteer and non-profit organizations that align with my ambitions. Of the various groups that I have spent time with, I have decided to invest the most time in two groups that most align with my goals.<br><br>

        The first of these groups is the COPE Health Scholar Program which has played the biggest role in affirming my future career aspirations while also supporting my current goals. The main site that I have spent my time at while volunteering with the program is at Riverside Community Hospital, which is one of the epicenters of support for those in need. The main goal of a health scholar is to be a key connecting piece between healthcare workers and patients by providing support to both groups. I began volunteering with them in the fall of 2021 and plan to continue up until my graduation in 2023. As a health scholar I have been fortunate enough to have numerous meaningful interactions with both the patients and the staff. The specific floors that I have been able to assist on include med-search floors, sterile storage, cardiovascular unit, postpartum, and labor and delivery. The ability to directly help the underserved and the frontline healthcare workers is an opportunity I will be forever grateful for, and I am certain that I have made strides towards directly positively impacting the community during my time as a health scholar. I hope to continue making strides as I move onto new departments and become a more integral part of the medicinal experience.<br><br>

        The second group that I have invested significant time in is the Brain Exercise Initiative. I have been volunteering with them since the spring of 2021, which was when the UCR branch was first established. In total this organization has 81 chapters across 4 different countries and is based upon the findings of Dr. Kawashima, who conducted numerous studies and trials to determine how performing arithmetic exercises can help activate the frontal cortex and slow down the effects of dementia. I am one of the team leaders with the Riverside chapter and I have mostly helped out at the Gardens of Riverside senior home. I started as a strictly virtual volunteer with the prgram when I first joined, but when the senior home was allowing visitors once more I transitioned to be the primary on-site volunteer for Gardens of Riverside specifically. My time with BEI has allowed me to forge connections with dozens of seniors in my community and help make a lasting impact on their mental health through the activities we perform.
